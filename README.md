# SingtelJavaAssignment
I have tried to use decorator pattern for this problem statement as I think the maintainability will be much easier.
In future if any animal comes with a different new behaviour, we can just create a new class with the same behaviour, no need to change any other class.

Commit # 1
To run the provided code I just changed couple of things to make sing() method work. Didn't make design related changes with this commit.

Commit # 2
Trying to decorate every object with its own specific behaviour ie, swimming, walking, singing etc.

Commit # 3 onwards
Created different behaviours mention and passed the required objects through them to wrap it into different behaviours.
